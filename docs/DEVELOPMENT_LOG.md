## Major Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. **Environment & Dependencies**
**Problem**: Package conflicts and CUDA compatibility issues
- `flash-attn` package conflicts with other dependencies
- CUDA version mismatches affecting PyTorch installation

**Solution**:
- Removed problematic packages from requirements.txt
- Used PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128 with CUDA 12.8 compatibility
- Isolated environment with specific package versions

**Files Modified**: `requirements.txt`

---

### 2. **Scheduler Compatibility**
**Problem**: DDIM scheduler doesn't support cosine beta schedule
```
ValueError: cosine schedule not supported by DDIMScheduler
```

**Solution**:
- Changed `beta_schedule` from "cosine" to "linear" in config
- Maintained same diffusion quality with linear schedule

**Files Modified**: `configs/coco.yaml`, `configs/debug.yaml`

---

### 3. **UNet-HintEncoder Channel Mismatches**
**Problem**: Runtime tensor size mismatches during hint injection
```
RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (192) must match the size of tensor b (384) at non-singleton dimension 1
```

**Root Cause**:
- Hint injection happens at different UNet layers than assumed
- Channel multiplier progression doesn't match injection timing
- 4GB VRAM optimizations broke architectural consistency

**Investigation Process**:
1. **Channel Tracing**: Created debug scripts to trace actual UNet channel progression
2. **Injection Point Analysis**: Found injection happens BEFORE channel multiplication, not after
3. **Architecture Debugging**: Discovered encoder/decoder block mismatches from reduced channels

**Solutions Attempted**:
```python
# Attempt 1: Simple calculation (FAILED)
unet_channels = [model_channels * mult for mult in channel_mult]  # [192, 384, 576, 768]

# Attempt 2: Injection timing correction (PARTIAL)
unet_channels = [model_channels, model_channels, model_channels, model_channels]  # [192, 192, 192, 192]

# Attempt 3: Empirical testing (SUCCESS)
unet_channels = [160, 160, 160, 320]  # From actual UNet tracing
```

**Final Solution**:
- Created `find_working_config.py` to empirically test configurations
- Found working tiny UNet: 160 base channels, [1,2,4,4] multipliers
- Matched HintEncoder output channels to empirical measurements

**Files Modified**: `train.py`, `src/models/hint_encoder.py`, `configs/coco.yaml`

---

### 4. **Memory Constraints (4GB VRAM)**
**Problem**: Out of memory errors during training and validation
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```

**Attempted Optimizations**:
1. **Batch Size Reduction**: 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
2. **Channel Reduction**: 320 → 256 → 192 → 160 base channels
3. **Architecture Simplification**: 2 → 1 ResNet blocks per level
4. **Gradient Accumulation**: Increased to maintain effective batch size
5. **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training enabled
6. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Enabled throughout

**Memory Profile Discovered**:
- Standard SD 1.5 (320 channels): >4GB VRAM
- Medium reduction (256 channels): >4GB VRAM
- Aggressive reduction (160 channels): ~3GB VRAM

**Files Modified**: `configs/coco.yaml`, multiple config iterations

---

### 5. **Text Encoder Dimension Mismatches**
**Problem**: Cross-attention expecting 768D but receiving 512D embeddings
```
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (308x512 and 768x384)
```

**Cause**: Switched text encoder from SD 1.5 (768D) to smaller CLIP (512D) for memory
**Solution**: Reverted to standard CLIP-large (768D) and used other memory optimizations

**Files Modified**: `configs/coco.yaml`

---

### 6. **Encoder/Decoder Block Consistency**
**Problem**: UNet decoder blocks expecting different channel counts than encoder provides
```
RuntimeError: Expected weight to be a vector of size equal to the number of channels in input, but got weight of shape [1920] and input of shape [1, 1280, 1, 1]
```

**Root Cause**:
- Reducing `model_channels` broke internal UNet architecture
- Encoder and decoder blocks have hardcoded channel expectations
- Diffusers UNet2DConditionModel has complex internal structure

**Status**: Identified but not fully resolved - requires either:
- Using standard channel counts (memory issue)
- Custom UNet implementation (architectural complexity)
- Different base model (compatibility issue)

---

### 7. **Logging & Tracking Issues**
**Problem**: Weights & Biases requiring API key during training
```
wandb: Enter your choice: 1
```

**Solution**:
- Switched from `wandb` to `tensorboard` logging
- Removed external service dependencies

**Files Modified**: `configs/coco.yaml`, `train.py`

---

### 8. **Pretrained Model Integration**
**Problem**: Pretrained SD 1.5 models too large for 4GB VRAM validation
```
Killed (code 137) - Out of memory
```

**Investigation**:
- SD 1.5 UNet: ~3.4GB model size
- Additional components (VAE, text encoder): ~1GB
- Total memory requirement: >4GB VRAM + system RAM

**Solutions Explored**:
1. **CPU validation**: Still killed due to system RAM limits
2. **Model streaming**: Complex implementation
3. **Smaller base models**: Compatibility issues

**Conclusion**: Hardware constraints require training from scratch rather than fine-tuning

---

## 🧪 Debugging Methodologies Used

### 1. **Channel Progression Tracing**
Created diagnostic scripts to trace tensor shapes through UNet:
```python
for i, block in enumerate(unet.encoder_blocks):
    print(f"Block {i}: res={h.shape[-1]}, channels={h.shape[1]}")
```

### 2. **Memory Profiling**
Systematic testing of configurations by memory usage:
```python
configs_to_test = [
    (320, [1, 2, 4, 4], "Standard"),
    (256, [1, 2, 4, 4], "Reduced"),
    (192, [1, 2, 4, 4], "Small"),
    (160, [1, 2, 4, 4], "Tiny"),
]
```

### 3. **Component Isolation**
Tested individual components to isolate failure points:
- VAE encoding/decoding separately
- UNet forward pass without training loop
- HintEncoder output validation
- Text encoder dimension checking

### 4. **Empirical Configuration Testing**
Built `find_working_config.py` to automatically test and validate configurations

---

## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. **4GB VRAM Reality Check**
- Modern diffusion models designed for 8GB+ VRAM
- Aggressive optimization often breaks architectural assumptions
- Training from scratch more viable than fine-tuning for low-memory

### 2. **Channel Matching Complexity**
- Hint injection timing is crucial and non-obvious
- UNet internal structure more complex than documentation suggests
- Empirical testing more reliable than theoretical calculation

### 3. **Memory vs Quality Trade-offs**
- Extreme memory optimization significantly reduces model capacity
- Batch size = 1 viable with gradient accumulation
- FP16 + gradient checkpointing essential for 4GB training

### 4. **Architecture Consistency**
- Diffusers models have internal consistency requirements
- Custom modifications require deep understanding of internals
- Standard configurations exist for good reasons

---

## Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Adaptive Channel Calculation**
```python
# Dynamic channel matching based on actual UNet structure
def calculate_injection_channels(unet):
    channels = []
    # Trace through encoder blocks to find actual channels
    # at each injection resolution
    return channels
```

### 2. **Memory-Optimized Training Configuration**
```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 1
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 32
  mixed_precision: fp16
  gradient_checkpointing: true

model:
  unet:
    model_channels: 160  # Empirically tested maximum for 4GB
    num_res_blocks: 1    # Minimal blocks
    use_checkpoint: true
```

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
Added comprehensive error handling and diagnostic information throughout training pipeline

### 4. **Configuration Validation System**
Built automated testing to validate configurations before training
